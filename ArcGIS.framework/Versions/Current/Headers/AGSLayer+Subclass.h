/** @brief Information relevant to sublcasses of @c AGSLayer
 
 This category organizes the  methods that are relevant to subclassing a layer.
 Developer can create custom layers by paying special attention to the methods in this category. 
 
 Although you can sublcass @c AGSLayer directly to create a custom layer, it will often be easier to subclass @c AGSTiledLayer, @c AGSTiledServiceLayer, or @c AGSDynamicLayer.
 
 If you want to implement a custom tiled layer, you should consider subclassing  @c AGSTiledLayer or @c AGSTiledServiceLayer.
 
 If you want to implement a custom dynamic layer, you should consider subclassing
 @c AGSDynamicLayer.
 
 Regardless of what class you subclass, here are some guidelines
 If you implement a custom layer, you should set the error when drawing:
 If the layer draws successfully, you should set the error to nil.
 If the layer fails to draw the error should be set there as well.
